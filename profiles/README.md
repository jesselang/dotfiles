Profiles
========

Profiles are a logical group of files that generally change together.
This can be useful for configurations that differ between work and home,
or some other factor.

If you have a set of dotfiles that only apply to work, you can symlink them to
`$HOME/.current`.

Operating System
----------------

The `os` directory contains configuration files that are only useful when
using a specific OS.
